# Homework 3

## Task 1: Estimating transcript expression using the EM algorithm
**Learning objective**: Understand how the EM algorithm can be used to estimate transcript expression and how it can be influenced by missing transcript annotations.

Your are given the following three transcripts with corresponding exon-level read counts. You can assume that all exons have equal length of 100 nucleotides. With the help of the

## Task 2: Identify transcripts that are differentially used between conditions
**Learning objective**: Learn how differentially used transcripts can be detected using DRIMSeq and how these changes can be visualized using IGV.

**Dataset:** [SummarizedExperiment object](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwl30are5g6k3ka/salmon_SummarizedExperiment_subset.rds?dl=0) ([alternative link](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmCRrTXF10_MgWr91VIHfVT9booG)) containing transcript expression estimated using Salmon. [BigWig files](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmCRrTXF10_MgWr91VIHfVT9booG) for visualisation.
**Software: **[DRIMSeq R package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DRIMSeq.html), IGV

## Task 3: Visualise differentially used transcripts using IGV
