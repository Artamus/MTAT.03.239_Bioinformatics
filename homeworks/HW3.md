# Homework 3

## Task 1: Estimating transcript expression using the EM algorithm
**Learning objective**: Understand how the EM algorithm can be used to estimate transcript expression and how it can be influenced by missing transcript annotations.

## Task 2: Identify transcripts that are differentially used between conditions
**Learning objective**: Learn how differentially used transcripts can be detected using DRIMSeq and how these changes can be visualized using IGV.
