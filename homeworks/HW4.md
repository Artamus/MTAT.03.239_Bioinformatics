## Task 1: Variance component analysis
**Learning objective:** Understand how hierarchical models (aka linear mixed models) can be used to estimate the proportion of total of variance explained by different factors.

Using the variance component analysis [tutorial](https://github.com/kauralasoo/flow_cytomtery_genetics/blob/master/analysis/variance_components/estimate_variance_components.md), repeat the the variance component analysis on the CD16 and CD206 markers.
