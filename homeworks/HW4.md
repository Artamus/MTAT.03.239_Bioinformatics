## Task 1: Variance component analysis
**Learning objective:** Understand how hierarchical models (aka linear mixed models) can be used to estimate the proportion of total of variance explained by different factors.

Using the variance component analysis [tutorial](https://github.com/kauralasoo/flow_cytomtery_genetics/blob/master/analysis/variance_components/estimate_variance_components.md), repeat the the variance component analysis for the CD16 and CD206 markers on both the full and replicated datasets. Do they give the same result as CD14, where most of the variance was explained by cell line?  If not, can you explain why? (HINT: you can use the same dot plots that were used under the section "Visualising sources of variation" to prove your point).
