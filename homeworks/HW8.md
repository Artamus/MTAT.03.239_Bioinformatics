You only need to do and report exercises that start with "Homework Exercise X (Y points)".
Into a PDF report include screenshots of code with resulting figures and answers
to questions (if any).

There is a bonus exercise (2 bonus points). You need to use open Mask R-CNN implementation
(from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)
instead of U-net for Homework Exercise: Splash of color. Report whatever will convince us
that you completed this exercise (figures, link to your fork, mofidied code etc).
