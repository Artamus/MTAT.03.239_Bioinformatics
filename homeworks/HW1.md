Test# Homework 1

## Task 1: Getting familiar with the IGV genome browser

 1. Download and run the [Integrative Genomics Viewer](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).
 2. Change the genome version to hg38 (top left corner)
 3. Search for the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene. Right click on the gene and select Expanded to see all of the annotate transcripts. How many annotated transcript does the SHH gene have?
 4. How long is the longest transcript? How far is it from closest neighbouring genes on the left and right?
 5. Now go to the lactase (LCT) gene (it's the gene that allows us to drink milk). How long is this on? How far is it from its neigbours?
 6. Zoom in
