# Homework 5

## Task 1: Understanding linkage disequilibrium (1.5 point)
How many variants are in high linkage disequilibrium with the lead CD14 QTL variant (R2 > 0.8)?

## Task 2: Calculating empirical p-values (2 points)
Permutation testing.

## Task 3: Understanding the mechanism of the CD14 QTL (1.5 points)
There are many possible ways how a genetic variant could change CD14 protein cell surface expression. One possibility is that the genetic variant changes the expression of the CD14 gene already at the mRNA level and this in turn influences how much protein is made. Alternatively, the genetic variant could directly regulated the
