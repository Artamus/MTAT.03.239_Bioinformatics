## Task 1: Understanding linkage disequilibrium (1.5 point)
How many variants are in high linkage disequilibrium with the lead CD14 QTL variant (R2 > 0.8)?

## Task 2: Calculating empirical p-values (2 points)
Permutation testing.

## Task 3: Understanding the mechanism of the CD14 QTL (1.5 points)
There are many possible ways how a genetic variant could change protein cell surface expression. One possibility is that the genetic variant changes the expression of the gene already at the mRNA level and this in turn influences how much protein is made. Alternatively, the genetic variant could directly regulate the rate of protein translation or its stability with no effect on the mRNA. Can you find out, which of these two mechanisms is more likely to be true in the case of CD14 and rs778587. You can find the read counts of the CD14 gene from the SummarizedExperiment object that you used in Homework
