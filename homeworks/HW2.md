# Homework 2

## Task 1: Exploratory data analysis
**Learning objective**: Learn how to use exploratory data analysis techniques to detect issues with data quality.

The [gene expression data tutorial](https://github.com/kauralasoo/MTAT.03.239_Bioinformatics/blob/master/gene_expression/Exploring_gene_expression.md) tells you how to get started with analysing gene expression data in R. The dataset used in the tutorial has already been cleaned, but this is usually not the case for real biological data. For example, sometimes samples can get accidentally mis-labeled in the laboratory. A common occurence (that has happened to me me as well!) is that different treatments from the same individual are accidentally swapped. 

In this exercise, your task is to download a 'dirty' [gene expression dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ogwvx9qf8hwt591/RNA_SummarizedExperiment_swapped.rds)
