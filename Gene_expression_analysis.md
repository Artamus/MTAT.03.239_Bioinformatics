 - [R Bioconductor cheat sheet](https://github.com/mikelove/bioc-refcard)
 - [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html) tutorial

## Setting up the command-line environment
For this week's practice session, you will need latest version of R together with RStudio and the following packages:
