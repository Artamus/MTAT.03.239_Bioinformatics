# Snakemake tutorial
Snakemake has an excellent online [tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html) on how the get started. You should be able to find answers to most of your questions from that tutorial, although, I admit, it can be quite difficult due to the large amount if information in there. There is also a shorter summary in the form of [slides](http://slides.com/johanneskoester/snakemake-tutorial-2016#/). Thus, to make it easier for you, I have but a couple of basic examples here as well.
