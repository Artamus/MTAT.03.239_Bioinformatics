# Setting up the software for environments for the Bioinformatics course

Bioinformatics software can be notoriously difficult to install. To make your life easier, we are going to perform all data analysis tasks using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. You are, of course, free to install all of the software in your own environment, but in this case we will not be able to provide any support when software issues do arise. Importantly, many bioinformatics tools do not run on Windows.

## Setting up docker
Your first task is to install docker. I recommend you to follow this excellent [tutorial](http://seankross.com/2017/09/17/Enough-Docker-to-be-Dangerous.html) to get familiar with the basic functionality of docker, including how to download images, how to start and stop containers and how to copy files between your own environment and the docker container.
