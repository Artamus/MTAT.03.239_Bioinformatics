# Pre-configured docker containers
We have now created a pre-configured docker container that has all of the necessary software installed. Once you have docker installed, you can download the container from DockerHub. Make sure that you have a fast Internet connection, because this file is over 5GB in size!

	docker pull kauralasoo/bioinfo_anaconda
